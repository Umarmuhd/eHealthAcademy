  <h1>Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star</h1>
  <p>
    Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
    How I wonder what you are!
    Up above the world so high,
    Like a diamond in the sky.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the blazing sun is gone,
    When he nothing shines upon,
    Then you show your little light,
    Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then the traveler in the dark
    Thanks you for your tiny spark,
    How could he see where to go,
    If you did not twinkle so?
  </p>
  <p>
    In the dark blue sky you keep,
    Often through my curtains peep
    For you never shut your eye,
    Till the sun is in the sky.
  </p>
